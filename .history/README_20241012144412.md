# Building My Own Kafka

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a Kafka-like messaging system using Go that can:
- Accept and respond to APIVersions and Fetch API requests.
- Encode and decode messages using the Kafka wire protocol.
- Handle network protocols, event loops, and TCP sockets.

Throughout this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the following concepts:
- The architecture of distributed messaging systems.
- The core functionalities of Kafka, including producers and consumers.
- Managing topics and partitions.
- Handling network communication in Go.
