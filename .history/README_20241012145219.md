# Building My Own Kafka

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a Kafka-like system using Go that can:
- Accept and respond to APIVersions and Fetch API requests.
- Encode and decode messages using the Kafka wire protocol.
- Handle network protocols, event loops, and TCP sockets.

Throughout this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the following concepts:
- The architecture of distributed messaging systems.
- The core functionalities of Kafka, including producers and consumers.
- Managing topics and partitions.
- Handling network communication in Go.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Go**: Ensure you have Go version 1.19 or higher installed on your local machine. You can download it from [Go Official Website](https://golang.org/).

2. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed for version control. You can download it from [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
cd repository
```
## Implementation Details

The main entry point for your Kafka implementation is located in `app/server.go`. Study the code, uncomment the relevant sections, and implement the necessary logic to pass each stage of the challenge.

## Running the Program  

To run your Kafka broker, use the following command:

```bash
./your_program.sh
```
This script will execute the application defined in app/server.go. Make sure to review the code and implement the required functionalities for handling requests.

# Testing and Submission

After implementing the required features, follow these steps to commit your changes and push them to the repository:

1. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

```
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # or your own message
```
2. Push your changes to the master branch:

```
git push origin master

```
3. The test output will be streamed to your terminal, allowing you to verify your implementation.
